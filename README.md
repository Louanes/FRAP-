I have my best friend who joined ‘Villiers-le-bel’ fire station at age of 16 as a volunteer, we both are in an French IT engineering school, and we want to make this project happen. He knows how an intervention really works, he’s part of the team a Battalion chief leads, for that reason we can provide an application that is truly useful and practical to France firefighters. Our application is there to support each decision took by the Battalion chief. The Battalion chief is the leader of the intervention team, he has to take into account a lot of variables and do a lot of calculations concerning the three different parts of an intervention :the water supply, the fire extinction and the people rescue parts. Our application gives all results of those important calculations. It will enable the Battalion chief to have the situation analyzed, therefore enable him to focus on managing his team in a more efficient way, and steer clear of any calculation errors that could occur and impact the whole result of the intervention.
